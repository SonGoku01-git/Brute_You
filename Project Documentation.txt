🔐 Project Documentation: Brute Force Automation Tool
Developer: Mayukh Biswas
Project Name: Ultra Instinct Brute Force Tool
Version: 1.0
Date: June 2025

📌 Project Overview
This project is a multi-protocol brute-force automation tool developed in Python that allows ethical hackers, penetration testers, and security researchers to test the strength of credentials for various network services like SSH, FTP, HTTP (form-based), and SMTP.

⚠ Disclaimer: This tool is intended for educational and authorized penetration testing purposes only. Unauthorized use of this tool is illegal and unethical.

🧠 Key Features
✅ Supports 4 major protocols: SSH, FTP, HTTP, SMTP

✅ Default ports auto-selected based on protocol

✅ Custom timeout or unlimited attack duration

✅ Auto-stops when credentials are found

✅ Custom wordlist input (user/pass files)

✅ Plays optional startup sound using pygame

✅ Simple terminal-based UI with emoji-based status feedback

✅ Stores successful login in success_logins.txt (for HTTP)

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.12

paramiko for SSH

ftplib for FTP

smtplib for SMTP

requests for HTTP POST login

pygame for optional sound

time, os modules for system operations

📄 Input Requirements
Target IP address

Protocol type (ssh, ftp, http, smtp)

Username file path

Password file path

Timeout in seconds (can be left blank to use full dictionary)

For HTTP only:

Login form URL

Username and password field names

Failure indicator keyword in the response

📂 Output
Displays live attempt status for each protocol.

Stops when a valid credential is found or time ends.

For HTTP, success credentials are logged in success_logins.txt.

🚫 Error Handling & Improvements
✔ UTF-8 decode errors are resolved by validating and cleaning wordlist input files.

✔ Added HTTP fallback status code and keyword-based logic to reduce false positives.

✔ Error handling for all login attempts (try-except).

⏳ Timeout logic included to stop long-running processes.

🧾 Added input validation for HTTP field names.

🧩 Future Upgrades (Suggested)
Auto-detect HTTP form fields (username, password) using BeautifulSoup.

Add multi-threaded attacks for speed (carefully throttle to avoid lockouts).

Include CAPTCHA or rate-limiting detection.

GUI interface for usability.

Protocol support expansion: RDP, Telnet, etc.

✅ Final Notes
This tool is a valuable asset for learning and practicing ethical hacking techniques related to password security. However, it must never be used on unauthorized systems. Always obtain permission and follow organizational rules and legal boundaries.
